## ShroudServer

This blog follows development of a private server for Shroud of the Avatar game. It's very much work in progress, but it's coming along nicely.

<!-- truncate -->
ShroudServer is hobby project of mine and the target is to create privately hostable server for Shroud of the avatar game. It's still very early in development, but certain things, that are techically the hardest, are in good shape and coming up nicely. I assume that readers know something about the game and I might say some keywords that only work in context of the game.

I started this blog, to record my doings and to report what is being done. There will be lots of techical jargon and something else, that can be more easily be digested. I'm willing to share everything I know about the networking and about the needed simulations. I have no fear that someone would try learn this and create their own implementation, infact, this is such a huge task that anyone willing to learn this, sounds good idea to me. I will share detailed information about my findings about network and everything related to the project.

### Tiny disclaimer
All the code I have in project, is done by me, everything else is MIT licensed libraries and tools. I don't have access to the real server code nor have I ever had. I have not copied any code that is not free to use. I do not represent any company or ideology. It's just my hobby project, that for now, only lives on my own development environment.

### Tiny About me
I'm Katu, finnish software developer. I have programmed most of my live, in numbers, about 30 years, half of it professionally. I love programming and pushing my self to learn more and more, and thats where this project also started. I have tons of kids and fulltime job, so my freetime for coding is somewhat limited.

### Beginnings of the ShroudServer

I played the game, Shroud of the Avatar for a good time and many things in the game clicked with me. It pulled me in with endless character templates, somewhat innovative combat system, player owned towns and houses. But, developers of the game, were streched all over the board, everything was in the making, yet nothing was ever done. I did not like some of the decisions made and nowadays just feel bad about the state of the game.

Sota has a fascinating architecture ( don't get too exited, the actual architecture is not fun ) when considering the fact that you can play the game offline and enjoy most of the features without server connection. This led me to think, that maybe the server is not doing that much of work and it could be faked somehow, easily.. (spoiler, not easy)

### I had an idea!

I'll write an private server for the game. Actually, it was not so clear at the time, considering that this happened somewhere between 2021-2022 and just now, It has become clear, that I could actually do this.
BUT, I found the good old spark, that has pushed me forward so many times before. Time to learn something new.

Fast forward to this day and I have gone through few different iterations and I'm finally thinking, that this is it. I'm doing it.



This was supposed to be short introduction to the blog and I will try to write about tech, architecture ( game and server ) and most importantly, about the progress. I can't promise any deadlines or anykind of set dates for anything basically.
